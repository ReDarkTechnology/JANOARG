# Rough ideas
(not final, might change at will)

- **Gameplay:** There will be three main sections:

    + **Rhythm:** This is the main gist of the game and is already implemented - the premise is every song is like a different thing compared to others - even the color scheme is pretty much song-based through the Pallete system.

    + **Visual novel:** How the game will communicate the game's lore (see Story). Pretty much every game has a visual novel section nowadays, so why not using it for our game?

    + **Metagame:** Game progression and stuff. This will probably end up getting more complex than the rhythm game part, which is already complex on its own, so I'll put the details down below the story.


- **Story:** The game revolves around people who lives in different worlds, talk to each other through some kind of a messaging app, and fix their world's "instabilities" by "connecting" them, which is where the rhythm game kicks in *(idk, not really sure with all these terminologies, the story also looks like it is heavily inspired by Homestuck a bit too much. I will also need to get a writer for this thing, and I'm already struggling to make the dev team bigger than just me)*

- **Metagame:** This is probably end up being the most complex progression system a rhythm game could have, so these will gradually be introduced to the player to avoid overloading the player with information.

    + **World Progression:** World progression will happen on a map, which may contains songs, items, story lines, or interactable locations such as shops. You gain world progress by playing the rhythm game, the harder the song's difficulty you selected and the better the performance, the more the progress you will make.

    + **Currencies:** The player is rewarded with currencies after playing a song, which will be used in certain actions, such as progressing through a map, or buying songs/items at shops. There will be three main currency types:

        * **Essence**: A "multiplier" currency, which is probably the most important thing in the game. Every song will give a certain amount of Essence, but only when you improve your performance in that song; either by setting a new record, or playing its harder difficulties; and there is a limit on how much Essence a song can potentially give you. You can also gain Essence using other means, for example getting / upgrading items, competing achievements, or leveling up. Essence will have a direct impact on how much of other currencies you will get - the more Essence you have, the easier you can get other currencies.

        * **Orbs**: A currency that is affected by Essence's effect, which can be used to upgrade items, which in turn can help you get more Orbs. Orbs also act as experience points - each Orb unit gained from playing equates to 1 experience point towards the next level. You can also passively get Orbs over time, even when the game is closed, to ease grinding, although this won't give any leveling EXP.

        * **Coins**: A currency that is not affected by Essence's effect, which can be used to buy items at shops, or use at occasions when using Orbs will throw off the balancing because of Essence's nature.

    + **Gimmicks:** Each world may also have its own "gimmick" progression system, like a world can have a "quest board" in which you can complete quests to get extra items and stuff.
