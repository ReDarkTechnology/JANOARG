Lane Style
$
A <b>Lane Style</b> instance contains appearance information related to Lanes. The Lanes can then 
select a Lane Style to determine its looks based on the Lane Style's current parameters.
$
<b>Note:</b> Styles are currently simplified to only use the default material in the standalone 
version of the Chartmaker, which makes the Material and Color Target fields unavailable.
