Hit Object
$
A <b>Hit Object</b> is the fundamental object type of the Playable Song structure. A Hit Object represents a note 
or a drum beat of the song and corresponds to an action the player must take at that point in the song.
$
For the record, the location where the Hit Object hits the edge of the Lane is called its <b>judgment zone</b> and 
the time it does so is the <b>judgment time</b>. A Hit Object will only register the action if it's done within 
its judgment zone. The player's performance is judged by how close the player's action is compared to the judgement 
timing.
