Lane Group
$
A <b>Lane Group</b> allows you to group multiple Lanes together and move them all at once without 
having to manually move them individually. A Lane that has a Lane Group as its parent will inherit that 
Lane Group's position and rotation and instead, will move and rotate accordingly.

Properties

$
 • <indent=2em><b>Reference Name</b> <i>(String)</i>:
$n
The name of the Lane Group that will be used as reference by the Lanes. It is 
recommended to rename it from the default name for ease of reference. Each Lane Group 
in a Chart must have different names to each other, to avoid conflicts.

$
 • <indent=2em><b>Parent</b> <i>(Lane Group, Optional)</i>:
$n
The parent of the Lane Group, which also happens to be a Lane Group. If set, all the child Lanes and 
Lane Groups will also inherit the parent Lane Group's movement. Be careful not to make any 
cyclical Lane Group references though...

$
 • <indent=2em><b>Position</b> <i>(3D Vector, Storyboardable)</i>:
$n
The position of the Lane Group in game space.

$
 • <indent=2em><b>Rotation</b> <i>(3D Vector, Storyboardable)</i>:
$n
The rotation of the Lane Group in degrees.
