Storyboard
$
The <b>Storyboard</b> is the most powerful feature of JANOARG. It allows objects inheriting the
Storyboard to be able to change its values as the song plays, therefore creating animations that 
can change and spice up the gameplay when used.

The Storyboard can animate Float values and data types that consists Float values, such as 
2D Vector, 3D Vector, and Color.

An object that inherits the Storyboard object is called a <i>Storyboardable</i> object. Most of 
the objects that are children of the Chart object are Storyboardable, and the fields that are marked 
as <i>Storyboardable</i> on their help pages can be animated using the Storyboard feature.
