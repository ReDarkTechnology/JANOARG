Hit Style
$
A <b>Hit Style</b> instance contains appearance information related to Hit Objects. The Hit Objects can then 
select a Hit Style to determine its looks based on the Hit Style's current parameters.
$
<b>Note:</b> Styles are currently simplified to only use the default material in the standalone 
version of the Chartmaker, which makes the Material and Color Target fields unavailable.
