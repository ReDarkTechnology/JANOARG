Metronome
$
The <b>Metronome</b> contains the information needed to align the game's timing unit (beats) to 
the actual beats of the song.
$
Most objects in JANOARG uses beats to represent that object's temporal position (a.k.a. position 
in the Timeline) that will be used for the game's logic (for example, the temporal position of a Hit 
Object indicates the position in the song that the object needs to be hit). The only exceptions are objects 
that don't have a temporal position (such as the Palette) and the BPM Stops, which uses seconds 
instead.
$
Since adjusting the Metronome can affect the final position of nearly all objects that contain a timing 
position, it is crucial to make sure the timing data is correct before starting any charting 
work. The Chartmaker contains certain features that can help you achieve this such as Metronome 
hinting sounds and showing the song's waveform representation on the Timeline.
