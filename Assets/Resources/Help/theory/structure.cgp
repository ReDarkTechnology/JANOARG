as well as references to a child object and/or a list of child objects.

Property Types
$
A JANOARG's object property can have one of the following data types:

$
 • <indent=2em><b>String</b>:
$n
A string of characters, a.k.a. text. (e.g. "JANOARG")

$
 • <indent=2em><b>Integer</b>:
$n
Whole numbers. (e.g. 3280, 4, 21)

$
 • <indent=2em><b>Float</b>:
$n
Floating point numbers, which can be either a whole number or a decimal number. (e.g. 3.7, 0.1, 98)

$
 • <indent=2em><b>2D Vector</b>:
$n
A vector that represents a 2D point in space, which contains 2 float values that correspond to the vector's 
X and Y position respectively.

$
 • <indent=2em><b>3D Vector</b>:
$n
Same as a 2D vector, but represents the 3D space instead. A 3D Vector has 3 float values that 
correspond to the vector's X, Y, and Z position respectively.

$
 • <indent=2em><b>Color</b>:
$n
An object containing 4 float values in the range of 0~1 that represent a color's Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha value respectively. 
(for example '0.184, 0.286, 0.616, 1' represents the color #2f499d in hex value)

$
 • <indent=2em><b>List</b>:
$n
A list of values that have the same data type. In this manual, a list of objects are presented under the 
"List<X>" syntax, where the X inside the angled bracket is replaced with the data type that the List accepts. 
(for example List<Hit Object> means a List of Hit Objects.)
